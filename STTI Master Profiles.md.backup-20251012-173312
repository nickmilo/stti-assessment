# STTI Profiles Master Content

This document contains ALL custom text content for the 24 STTI sensemaking profiles as currently implemented in the system. This serves as the master source for all profile-specific content that can be edited and then re-integrated into the architecture.

## Content Structure

Each profile has seven main content sections:
- **Archetype Description**: Standard text explaining the dominant/secondary archetype combination
- **Orientation Description**: Profile-specific text explaining the orientation (Westerner, Easterner, etc.) and tendency
- **Tendency Description**: Standard text explaining Architect vs Gardener approach
- **Overwhelmed**: How each orientation handles being overwhelmed
- **Stuck/Unstuck**: Guidance for getting unstuck based on profile combination
- **Prompts**: Specific questions to help transition between archetypes
- **Archetype Synergy**: How the two dominant archetypes work together (only implemented for IS profiles currently)

## Sensemaking Tendencies Copy 

### Understanding your sensemaking tendencies (thinking styles)

This section articulates the differences between top-down "Architect" or bottom-up "Gardener". Neither style is better than the other. Both are needed.

#### If your *Architect (Top-down)* score is higher than your *Gardener (Bottom-up)* score...

**"Convergent thinker"** (Healthy tendency): You enjoy seeing the big picture. When possible, you prefer knowing more about a subject or situation before you act. You like categorizing, and you use the big picture to further your sensemaking and decision-making. You are a good organizer and benefit from having a few lists and maps to guide your actions. The question is, can your convergent thinking be loose enough to allow for emergent thinking?

**"Fragile thinker"** (Unhealthy tendency): When taken too far, your tendency to architect can lead to stifling, rigid thinking. When that need sets in, you can become paralyzed when you don't have enough structure. This can manifest in coming across as needy and overburdening others. Sometimes it can even turn brainstorming sessions into prosecutions.

#### If your *Gardener (Bottom-up)* score is higher than your *Architect (Top-down)* score...

**"Divergent Thinker"** (Healthy tendency): You are comfortable without having a complete high-level picture. Instead, you are able to work with limited information and follow the trail of enthusiasm, clues, and connections. You generate a lot of thoughts. The question is, can your divergent thinking lead to emergent thinking?

**"Scattered Thinker"** (Unhealthy tendency): When taken too far, your tendency to garden can lead to a chronic sense of anxiety around trying to find things—whether it's car keys or old notes. One tendency of unhealthy bottom-up thinking is to chronically collect new and exciting information...never to touch it again.

## Boilerplate to define the four Sensemaking Archetypes

### Understanding the Archetypes

**Inner Guides** want to nourish their minds and reflect on their place in the world. Self-exploration and self-discovery are most important to them, with the end goal being the cultivation of a meaningful life where values, intentions and actions are aligned. 

This archetype is embodied by lifelong learners, personal development enthusiasts, people at transition points in life searching for clarity on who they are and where they want to go, and those who feel a strong need to move away from the noise of other people’s thoughts and find grounding and calmness in their own. 

**Synthesizers** want to collect, reorganize and reframe knowledge. Whether the source information is the dozens of sparks flying through their mind in a day or multiple books, articles and videos, synthesizers are driven to make connections among disparate ideas and find clarity in complexity. 

This archetype is embodied by professional researchers, educators, students, and deep thinkers in all disciplines. 

**Producers** want to flourish in their careers and get things done. They are driven to apply what they’ve learned to clear outcomes, embracing workflows and systems that help them to be more efficient and effective in tracking progress and moving efforts forward, taking action and prioritizing tangible results.

This archetype is embodied by entrepreneurs, managers, students at particular points in their learning, and anyone who is aspiring for professional or academic growth. 

**Creatives** want to express their inner selves in unique and meaningful ways. They are driven to develop skills in the medium of their choice so they can share their knowledge and experiences in ways that are helpful and impactful to others. It’s not always obvious why a creative is spending time on certain things, but those things often flavor their thoughts and ideas in unique ways.

This archetype is embodied by active or aspiring authors, writers, and creators of all kinds.

### Archetype Description
The **Inner Guide** (dominant) and **Producer** (secondary) archetype combination creates a converter's approach to sensemaking. You excel at transforming deep insights into practical applications, bridging the gap between meaning and action. Your strength lies in your ability to take abstract understanding and convert it into concrete, productive outcomes.

### Orientation Description
As an **IP-Architect**, you have a **Diagonal** profile with a tendency to **architect** (notice how the image spans diagonally across quadrants). You are known as "converters." You excel at transforming inner insights into productive action, bridging the gap between meaning and execution. Your diagonal nature allows you to move fluidly between reflection and creation.

### Tendency Description
The **Architect** is your dominant sensemaking tendency. This means you gravitate towards structuring and organizing the things around you. However, it doesn't mean the things around you are organized, only that you prefer clarity and understanding over uncertainty, but sometimes even…opportunities.

### Overwhelmed

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status
- **2 profiles** (IS-Architect, IS-Gardener) have full implementation including archetype synergy content in `profiles.json`
- **22 profiles** have hardcoded content in `main.js` for overwhelmed, stuck/unstuck, and prompts sections
- **11 profiles** are marked as "broken" and have their sections hidden in the current implementation

### Orientation Patterns
The content follows clear patterns based on orientation:

- **Westerners** (IS, SI): Focus on moving from reflection to expression/action
- **Easterners** (CP, PC): Focus on slowing down from action to reflection
- **Northerners** (PS, SP): Focus on balancing structure with innovation/meaning
- **Southern** (CI, IC): Focus on grounding exploration with structure/direction
- **Translators** (CS, SC): Focus on managing translation complexity and depth
- **Converters** (IP, PI): Focus on balancing between reflection and action rhythms

### Tendency Patterns
- **Architects**: Prefer systematic, structured approaches to accessing difficult archetypes
- **Gardeners**: Prefer organic, flexible approaches to accessing difficult archetypes

### Architecture Notes
- The system uses both hardcoded content in `main.js` and JSON-based content in `profiles.json`
- The `ProfileRenderer` class provides a modern, data-driven approach for rendering profile content
- Profile content follows a consistent structure across all implementations
- The current system is designed to be easily maintainable and expandable
